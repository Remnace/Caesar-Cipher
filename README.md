# Caesar-Cipher
Given a string and a shift factor, the program will shift a character of the string right by the shift factor.

<h2>Example:</h2> 
given a string: "lmnop" and shift factor: 2 the output would be "nopqr"

<br />

#Stocks
Given an array of stock prices, each index correlates to a day starting from 0, and you must buy before you sell. The program finds the maximum possible difference(profit).

<h2>Example:</h2>
Given [17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10], it will return [1,4] because at index 1 is 3 and at index 4 is 15 thus the difference is 12.

<br />

#Substrings
Given a word and a dictionary of words, the program will output a hash containing all the words that the given word contains as substrings and the number of times they occur within the input word.

<h2>Example:</h2>
Given a dictionary: dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

and an input word: "below"

The program should output: {"below"=>1, "low"=>1}
